    activated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    responded_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    notes TEXT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (booking_id) REFERENCES bookings(id),
    INDEX idx_status_activated (status, activated_at)
);

-- Emergency Contacts Table
CREATE TABLE emergency_contacts (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    user_type ENUM('passenger', 'driver') NOT NULL,
