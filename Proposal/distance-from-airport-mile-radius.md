```sql
-- Airports Table
CREATE TABLE airports (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    iata_code VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    icao_code VARCHAR(4) NULL,
    latitude DECIMAL(10, 8) NOT NULL,

    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    SPATIAL INDEX idx_airport_location (latitude, longitude)
);

-- Airport Zones Table
CREATE TABLE airport_zones (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    airport_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    zone_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    zone_type ENUM('pickup', 'dropoff', 'restricted', 'surcharge') NOT NULL,

);

-- Airport Bookings Table (extend existing bookings)
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN pickup_airport_id BIGINT NULL;
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN dropoff_airport_id BIGINT NULL;

## Airport Zone Examples

### **Miami International Airport (MIA)**
```json
{
  "name": "Miami International Airport",
  "iata_code": "MIA",
  "latitude": 25.7932,
  "longitude": -80.2906,
  "zones": [
    {
      "zone_name": "Terminal Pickup",
      "zone_type": "pickup",
      "radius_miles": 0.5,
      "surcharge_amount": 5.00
    },
    {
      "zone_name": "Airport Vicinity",
      "zone_type": "surcharge",
      "radius_miles": 3.0,
      "surcharge_amount": 3.00
    },
    {
      "zone_name": "Extended Airport Area",
      "zone_type": "surcharge",
      "radius_miles": 5.0,
      "surcharge_amount": 1.50
    }
  ]
}
```

## Distance Calculation Logic

### **Haversine Formula Implementation**
```php
public function calculateDistanceInMiles($lat1, $lon1, $lat2, $lon2) {
    $earthRadius = 3959; // Earth's radius in miles
    
    $dLat = deg2rad($lat2 - $lat1);
    $dLon = deg2rad($lon2 - $lon1);
    
    $a = sin($dLat/2) * sin($dLat/2) + 
         cos(deg2rad($lat1)) * cos(deg2rad($lat2)) * 
         sin($dLon/2) * sin($dLon/2);
    
    $c = 2 * atan2(sqrt($a), sqrt(1-$a));
    
    return $earthRadius * $c;
}
```

- **Peak time handling**: Adjust surcharges during busy periods
- **Refund policies**: Handle disputes over airport charges

### **User Experience**
- **Clear notifications**: Inform users when entering airport zones
- **Fee transparency**: Show airport surcharges before booking confirmation
- **Terminal guidance**: Help users navigate to correct pickup points
- **Wait time management**: Handle longer wait times at airports

### **Performance Considerations**
- **Spatial indexing**: Efficient database queries for location-based searches
- **Caching strategy**: Cache airport data to reduce API calls
- **Background processing**: Efficient location monitoring without battery drain

## Key Benefits

- **Revenue optimization**: Additional revenue from airport surcharges
- **Service differentiation**: Specialized airport service offerings
- **Operational efficiency**: Better management of airport pickups/dropoffs
- **Regulatory compliance**: Meet airport authority requirements
- **Driver compensation**: Fair compensation for airport service challenges

## Success Metrics

- **Airport booking volume**: Number of airport-related rides
- **Surcharge revenue**: Additional revenue from airport fees
- **Driver satisfaction**: Driver acceptance of airport jobs
- **User satisfaction**: User experience with airport service
- **Operational efficiency**: Reduced wait times and improved service

This feature would provide Go Gulf with sophisticated airport service capabilities, enabling them to offer specialized airport transportation with appropriate pricing while ensuring regulatory compliance and optimal user experience for airport-related trips.
